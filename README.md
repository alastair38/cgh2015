#Joints Accessible

This is based on JointsWP (which itself uses Foundation), a project by [@jeremyenglert](https://twitter.com/jeremyenglert). [Follow Jeremy](https://twitter.com/jeremyenglert) on Twitter to keep up-to-date with JointsWP.

My aim is to adapt the theme further for greater accessibility and ARIA support. This is a work in progress as I find out more about the pitfalls of making WP themes fully accessible.

### How to use Bower and Update to the Latest Version of Foundation
JointsWP supports Bower, which allows you to update the included libraries (under `bower_components`) with a single command. If you're new to Bower and don't have it installed, see [Bower.io](http://bower.io/) for installation instructions. 

From the command line, navigate to your main theme directory. Then run:
`bower update`
